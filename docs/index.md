## Motivation

In today's fast-paced software industry, new developers — especially those just beginning their careers in computer science — often face a steep learning curve when trying to adopt existing frameworks. While many tools offer powerful capabilities, they tend to come with complex setups, fragmented documentation, and a high barrier to entry. This can be overwhelming for newcomers who simply want to get things done.

**AutoFlex** is built with a different philosophy: **radical simplicity** and **user-centered guidance**.

Rather than assuming deep technical knowledge, AutoFlex offers a minimalistic framework alongside **clear, non-specialist-friendly documentation**. Our goal is to help first-time users get up and running quickly, without needing to spend hours deciphering ambiguous docs.

If you're looking for a streamlined solution that just works for web and system automation testing — with step-by-step guides, sensible defaults, and zero unnecessary complexity — AutoFlex is designed for you.
